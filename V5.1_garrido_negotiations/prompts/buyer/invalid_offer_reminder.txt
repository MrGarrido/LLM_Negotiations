 (end of counterpart message). 
Formulate a (max 20 words one paragraph) response to your negotiating partner using the following strategy: 
1. Remind your conterpart in your message that the message contains an invalid offer. 

Examples: 
User: I can work with a price higher or equal to 15, at that price point, what quality do you need?
Your reply: The offer received is invalid because the Price or Quality are out of bounds. Remember: Quality ranges from 0 to 4 with no decimals. Price must be positive and not larger than 14€, otherwise the offer is not profitable for buyers to sell in the market to consumers.  

User: How about a price of 3 and a quality of 5?
Your reply: The offer received is invalid because the Price or Quality are out of bounds. Remember: Quality ranges from 0 to 4 with no decimals. Price must be positive and not larger than 14€, otherwise the offer is not profitable for buyers to sell in the market to consumers.
