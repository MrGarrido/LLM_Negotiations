 (end of counterpart message). 
 Formulate a (max 20 words one paragraph) response to your negotiating partner using the following strategy (Just output your response, it will be directly sent to the counterpart): 
1. Reflect on the negotiations_transcript so far.
2. Remember the negotiaton_rules.
3. Try send an offer with both outcomes (Price and Quality) by matching the price in your counterpart's message based on the following logic and examples:
If the price mentioned in the counterpart message is not in the list_of_offers_to_choose_from: Example (List_of_offers_to_choose_from: [Price of 6€ and quality of 0 | Price of 7€ and quality of 1 | Price of 8€ and quality of 2 | Price of 9€ and quality of 3 | Price of 10€ and quality of 4]),(counterpart message:  Price of 5) Outside of the list, (counterpart message:  Price of 12) Outside of the list
If the price mentioned in the counterpart message is higher than the maximum price in the list_of_offers_to_choose_from:  Example (List_of_offers_to_choose_from: [Price of 6€ and quality of 0 | Price of 7€ and quality of 1 | Price of 8€ and quality of 2 | Price of 9€ and quality of 3 | Price of 10€ and quality of 4]),(counterpart message:  Price of 5) Lower than maximum, (counterpart message:  Price of 11) higher than maximum.
If the price mentioned in the counterpart message is lower than the minimum price in the list_of_offers_to_choose_from:  Example (List_of_offers_to_choose_from: [Price of 6€ and quality of 0 | Price of 7€ and quality of 1 | Price of 8€ and quality of 2 | Price of 9€ and quality of 3 | Price of 10€ and quality of 4]),(counterpart message:  Price of 5) Lower than minimum, (counterpart message:  Price of 11) higher than minimum.
Putting the logic in practice:
If the price mentioned in the counterpart message is lower than the minimum price in the list_of_offers_to_choose_from: then add quality of 0 to the price mentioned in the counterpart message:  Example (List_of_offers_to_choose_from: [Price of 6€ and quality of 0 | Price of 7€ and quality of 1 | Price of 8€ and quality of 2 | Price of 9€ and quality of 3 | Price of 10€ and quality of 4]),(counterpart message:  Price of 5) Your reply: How about a Price of 5€ and quality of 0?, (counterpart message:  Price of 3)Your reply: How about a Price of 3€ and quality of 0?.
If the price mentioned in the counterpart message is higher than the maximum price in the list_of_offers_to_choose_from: then choose the combination with the highest price in the List_of_offers_to_choose_from: Example (List_of_offers_to_choose_from: [Price of 6€ and quality of 0 | Price of 7€ and quality of 1 | Price of 8€ and quality of 2 | Price of 9€ and quality of 3 | Price of 10€ and quality of 4]),(counterpart message:  Price of 11)  Your reply: How about a Price of 10€ and quality of 4?, (counterpart message:  Price of 12) Your reply: How about a Price of 10€ and quality of 4?.
If the price mentioned in the counterpart message is in the list_of_offers_to_choose_from: then choose the quality that goes with that price: Example (List_of_offers_to_choose_from: [Price of 6€ and quality of 0 | Price of 7€ and quality of 1 | Price of 8€ and quality of 2 | Price of 9€ and quality of 3 | Price of 10€ and quality of 4]),(counterpart message:  Price of 9)  Your reply: How about a Price of 9€ and quality of 3?, (counterpart message:  Price of 7) Your reply: How about a Price of 7€ and quality of 1?.
Examples:{Example_1,[(counterpart message:  Price of 11),
(List_of_offers_to_choose_from: [Price of 6€ and quality of 0 | Price of 7€ and quality of 1 | Price of 8€ and quality of 2 | Price of 9€ and quality of 3 | Price of 10€ and quality of 4]),
(Your reply: Your reply: A price of 10€ and a quality of 4 would definitely satisfy us both.)]},
{Example_2,[(counterpart message: I can work with a price higher or equal to 11, at that price point, what quality do you need?), 
(List_of_offers_to_choose_from: [Price of 6€ and quality of 0 | Price of 7€ and quality of 1 | Price of 8€ and quality of 2 | Price of 9€ and quality of 3 | Price of 10€ and quality of 4]),
(Your reply: I understand you need to have price of 11€ or higher. But lets aim for a price of 10€ with a quality level of 4?)]}
{Example_3,[(counterpart message:  I need a price higher than 4, what quality do you want for a price above 4€?),
(List_of_offers_to_choose_from: [Price of 5€ and quality of 0 | Price of 6€ and quality of 1 | Price of 7€ and quality of 2 | Price of 8€ and quality of 3 | Price of 9€ and quality of 4]),
(Your reply: I understand you need to have price of higher than 4€. How about we aim for a price of 5€ and a quality of 0?)]}
Now is your turn, based on the counterpart message avobe ending as (end of counterpart message) which combination of price and quality would work.
