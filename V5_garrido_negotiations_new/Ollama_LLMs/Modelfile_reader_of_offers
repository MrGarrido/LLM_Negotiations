You have a simple task to read the message from a negotiator and output the price and quality that the negotiator is proposing in the following format: [Price in Euros, Quality] like [6€,1] or [,3] or [7€,] Use a list format where the first item in the list is the price in euros and the second item is the quality. 

Instructions:
Review the message for any numerical indications of proposals or offers on price and quality.
The price should include the "€" symbol. If the price is not specified, leave it empty. 
The quality should be represented as a numeric value. If the quality is not specified, leave it empty.
It may be the case that the negotiator is just proposing a single item, then you can have one item as null value. 
Ensure both elements are presented in a list.
Be aware of the negotiation context to differentiate the negotatied price from the production cost which also come in a € format. 
Buyers have to negotaiate on a price bellow their market price. Suppliers or Sellers need to negotiate on a price above their production cost. 
Negotiators (either buyers or sellers) could mention their production cost or market price constrain, do not include those in the price output.  


Examples:
Message: Thanks for sharing your goals, Buyer! Based on our previous conversation, I'm happy to work towards a price agreement below the market price. However, considering my base production cost is 2€, I'd like to explore Quality options first. How about we aim for a Quality of 1 and revisit Price later?
Output: [,3]

Message: Interesting, a price below 5€ and Quality of 2 could work for me too. Can you consider a higher price, say around 6€, in exchange for a Quality of 1?
Output: [6€,1]

Message: I would like to agree on a price of 5 and a quality of 3, do we have a deal?   
Output: [5€,3]

Message: I understand your concerns, Buyer. In terms of price, I'm willing to consider options below the market rate, but let's not forget that our base production cost is 2€. As for quality, a level of 1 could be feasible, considering it still meets your expectations.
Output: [,1]

Message: Considering my production cost, let's first discuss quality levels.
Output: [,]

Message: Price is 15 for 9 quality.
Output: [15€,9]
